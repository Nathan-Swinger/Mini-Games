# Mini-Games
A Python application full of different mini games

What I learned:
- Working with multiple classes and functions
- Comparing and working with strings, ints, booleans, floats
- User input validation in Python
- Continuously running a program until a user chooses to terminate program by choosing quit option
- Working with random numbers and using that to generate useful data for functions involving chance
- Python flow control and the differences between local/global variables
